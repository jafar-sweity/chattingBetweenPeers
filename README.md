# Peer-to-Peer Chat Application

## Overview

This project involves the development of a Peer-to-Peer Chat Application using Java with both UDP and TCP Socket Programming. The application includes a graphical user interface (GUI) with features such as message exchange, timestamping, message coloring, and the ability to delete messages. The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Part 1 (Question 1):** Implement a basic Peer-to-Peer Chatting Application using Java with UDP Socket Programming.

2. **Part 2 (Question 2):** Extend the application to incorporate TCP Java Socket programming. This part includes the addition of a TCP server to manage active clients and facilitate communication between them.

## Project Structure

- **Part1:** Contains the implementation for the basic Peer-to-Peer Chatting Application using UDP Socket Programming.
  - `UDPChatApp.java`: Main class for the UDP chat application.
  - `UDPServer.java`: UDP server implementation.
  - `UDPClient.java`: UDP client implementation.

- **Part2:** Extends Part 1 to incorporate TCP Socket Programming and includes server-client communication for managing active clients.
  - `TCPChatApp.java`: Main class for the extended application.
  - `TCPServer.java`: TCP server implementation for managing active clients.
  - `TCPClient.java`: TCP client implementation with registration to the TCP server.
